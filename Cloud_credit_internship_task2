Hello! everyone 
Welcome to my github profile

In this project, we analyze the Boston Housing Dataset using Linear Regression to predict house prices based on various factors. We utilize the scikit-learn library to load the dataset and perform model training and evaluation.

Steps Involved:
Loading the Dataset:

The Boston dataset is available in sklearn. datasets and contains information about various housing attributes in Boston.

It includes 506 samples with 13 input features related to housing prices.

Data Preprocessing:

Convert the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for better visualization and manipulation.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Applying Linear Regression:

Fit a Linear Regression Model to predict the target variable (house prices).

Use the sklearn—linear_model module.

Evaluating Model Performance:

Compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

Calculate the R² Score, which indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.
